Logger is a powerful [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot meant to give staff members oversight over the various actions taking place in their server. Come talk about me with my creator at [Logger's Lounge](https://discord.gg/ed7Gaa3).

This branch (.exe) contains the code packaged into the executable being distributed on the releases page here and in Discord. **The license includes an additional statement that you must read if you want to use this!**

  Some of the coding choices made in this branch are pretty confusing (command and event indexers hardcoding requires instead of using fs), but honestly I'll do them later. Have fun with this, jeez!

## Installation
1. Download the correct zip for your operating system
2. Extract all files in the zip into a folder *together*
3. Rename config.txt.example to config.txt
4. Fill out __all values__ in config.txt
5. Run the executable
6. Navigate to http://localhost:8082 in your browser

  

## Usage
